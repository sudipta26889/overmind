"""``aggregate_run`` (the chord callback) is the only task that flips an EvalRun to COMPLETED,
and ``eval.py``'s ``link_error`` only fires for tasks that raise — neither covers a chord barrier
that silently never completes.

Staleness anchor: the pipeline mutates EvalRun exclusively via ``QuerySet.update()``, which
bypasses ``auto_now``, so the eval tasks stamp ``updated_at`` by hand; scoring progress is read
from ``Score.created_at`` instead. Stalled means neither advanced.
